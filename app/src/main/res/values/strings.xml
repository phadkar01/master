        NEW DELHI: The State Bank of India (SSI) on Sunday clarified that the facility of
        exchange of Rs 2,000 denomination notes up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time will
        be allowed without obtaining any requisition slip.

        It added that no identity proof will be required at the time of exchange either.
        The clarification seeks to quell doubts about the need for any form or slip at the
        time of exchanging or depositing Rs 2,000 notes by customers.

        The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday announced the withdrawal of Rs 2,000
        currency notes from circulation.

        It said that existing notes in circulation can either be deposited in bank accounts
        or exchanges by September 30

        The bank notes in Rs 2,000 denomination will continue to be a legal tender, the
        RBI said in a statement.

        In order to ensure operational convenience and to avoid disruption of regular
        activities of bank branches, the RBI said exchange of Rs 2,000 bank notes into
        bank notes of other denominations can be made up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a
        time at any bank starting from May 23, 2023.
